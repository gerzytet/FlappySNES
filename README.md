# How to run
Use any SNES emulator.  This game was tested primarily with bsnes.
The ROM file is `flappy.sfc`

# How to compile
Download the [asar assembler](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar)
and place it in the root of the project as `asar.exe`, then run the `compile.bat` script.

Compiling on other platforms should be possible with slight modification to the compile script.
